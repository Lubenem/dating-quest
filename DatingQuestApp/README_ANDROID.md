## Quick Test Right Now

**The easiest way to test immediately:**

2. **Open Chrome on your phone**
3. **Go to**: `http://100.115.92.198:8000`

## Troubleshooting

**If the phone can't connect:**
- Check that both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Try using your computer's actual IP address
- Make sure the Python server is still running
- Try using a different port: `python3 -m http.server 8080`

**If you get "Add to Home screen" option:**
- The PWA is working! This gives you a native app experience
- The app will work offline after first load
- It will have its own icon and launch like a real app

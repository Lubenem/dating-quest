🎮 Dating Quest – Game Design Document
✨ Essence of the Game
Dating Quest is not just a tracker — it’s an RPG-style adventure designed to gamify the challenging yet rewarding experience of approaching women in real life. The goal is not the outcome of each interaction, but the courage, consistency, and growth of the player. Every outing is a mission, every interaction is an XP opportunity, and every milestone is an achievement. This game transforms fear into play, hesitation into progress, and rejection into experience points. The soul of Dating Quest is about fun, self-improvement, and adventure.

⚔️ Boss Quests
Boss Quests are weekly high-difficulty challenges that push the player out of comfort zones. They are meant to be rare but highly rewarding.
• Approach someone sitting down

• Approach while she is busy (e.g., shopping, studying, waiting)
• Give a compliment in front of her friends
• Approach the most intimidating person you see that day
• Ask someone out within 2 minutes of meeting
🔥 Streak System
The streak keeps momentum alive. The player must do at least 1 approach each day to keep it. Rewards can be self-assigned: small treats for 7 days, bigger ones for 30 days.
🎲 Randomizer Pool
To keep the game fresh, the player can roll or shuffle random challenges. Expanded pool:
• Opinion opener (ask for advice on food, fashion, books)
• Compliment something specific (jacket, hair, smile)
• Humor opener (light joke, situational humor)
• Direct approach ('You’re cute, I had to say hi')
• Situational question (location-based)
• Ask what she’s reading/listening to
• Challenge her playfully (tease lightly)
• Ask her to recommend a song
• Ask her opinion on a trending topic
• Pretend you’re lost and ask for directions
• Introduce yourself casually ('Hey, I’m Alex by the way')
• Freestyle – make up something new on the spot
💡 Closing Notes
Dating Quest is built on the principles of courage, consistency, and gamification. The app should make the user feel rewarded regardless of outcome. Each interaction is XP. Each day is a chance to level up. The system must encourage fun, lightness, and growth, so the player never feels punished for trying.
